## Project One: Trail-LAD

Project ones goal was to create a MVP website using the knowledge obtained in the first six weeks of the bootcamp.

We did this by utilizing the following skills and technologies:

- Deployment

- Client-side(local) Storage
- Responsive Design
- Polished UI

## Requirements

- Use of a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
    We used Tailwind
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages
    https://dugbb.github.io/trail-lad/
- Be interactive and responsive to user input
    The user has to pick which state to look for National Parks in, and in which park zipcode to choose a restaurant list 
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
    National Parks API:  https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm
    EndPoint API:  https://documenu.com/docs#api_endpoint
- Do not use alerts, confirms, or prompts
    Printed information to the screen in the applicable place instead of using an alert, ect.
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
    We stored the state initials, and any states that produce errors in local storage
- Be responsive
    Buttons respond when used to choose state and restaurant information
- Have a polished UI
    Tailwind was used to make the website polished and attractive
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards
    File structure, naming conventions, indentation, comments, ect. are being utilized
